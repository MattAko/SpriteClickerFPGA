2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP mmio_unit/ddfs_slot12/ddfs_unit/modu input mmio_unit/ddfs_slot12/ddfs_unit/modu/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP mmio_unit/ddfs_slot12/ddfs_unit/modu multiplier stage mmio_unit/ddfs_slot12/ddfs_unit/modu/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

REQP-1839#1 Warning

The RAMB36E1 video_sys_unit/buf_unit/frame_src_unit/vram_unit/ram_256k_unit/ram_reg_0_0 has an input control pin video_sys_unit/buf_unit/frame_src_unit/vram_unit/ram_256k_unit/ram_reg_0_0/ADDRBWRADDR[14] (net: video_sys_unit/buf_unit/frame_src_unit/vram_unit/ram_256k_unit/O[0]) which is driven by a register (video_sys_unit/frame_counter_unit/hc_reg_reg[10]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 video_sys_unit/v1_mouse_unit/mouse_src_unit/ram_unit/ram_reg has an input control pin video_sys_unit/v1_mouse_unit/mouse_src_unit/ram_unit/ram_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[13] (net: video_sys_unit/v1_mouse_unit/mouse_src_unit/ram_unit/ADDRBWRADDR[9]) which is driven by a register (video_sys_unit/frame_counter_unit/vc_reg_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
